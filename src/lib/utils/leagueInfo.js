  <p>Founded in 2016, the Dirty Soda Fantasy League began as a 10-man league amongst a small group of friends and family. In 2019, the league appointed a new commissioner, Yvens, who took over a lawless era, dubbed “ Stan the Terrible”. This was also the year the league converted into a full-fledged 12-man league. Each year, the managers compete to win the prestigious, Dirty Soda Bowl and avoid the ever-humiliating Shit Bowl.</p>
  <p>The league has experienced turbulent times, notably: Bye-gate, verbal sparring, exiles, several claims of collusion and Daniel’s winless 2017 season. Still, the foundations of the league have been fortified. As we head into a new season of great change, Will currently sits at the top with the most titles (3).</p>
